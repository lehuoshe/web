<tr><td>I got really mad after I found out one support engineer from an <a href="../../../ar1688/index.html">AR1688</a> and <a href="../../../pa1688/index.html">PA1688</a> device manufacturer did not know how to do AR1688 <a href="../pa6488/20090927.php">safe mode</a> recovery after so many years.
<br />At first he copied the upgrade file to a directory, and then he run the command line "tftp -i 192.168.1.200 put xxxxxx_sip_us_048000.bin" in another directory, after getting the error of file not found, he came to ask me on MSN. Because I remember him as the one who only knew to forward end user's question to us and cause <a href="../pa1688/20100606.php">false alarm</a> in the past years, I told him that we do not do basic computer operation training.
<br />Then he began to run a Cisco TFTP program and ask me why AR1688 device do not work as others he had handled in the past. I guess he can not understand the difference between TFTP server and client. I had to tell him that we just need the native tftp.exe coming with Windows system and nothing else, and suggest him to use current steady <a href="../../../ar1688/software/sw054.html">0.54</a> version instead of 0.48. 
<br />Tired of wasting my time with him, finally I had to find another engineer in his company to show him the way. He got hurt and asked why I insulted him!
<br />Maybe just because I am in a bad mood recently.
