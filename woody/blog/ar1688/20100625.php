<tr><td>We built nearly 100 AR168M VoIP modules 28 months ago. About 30 customers had bought the <a href="20080225.php">module</a> during this period and 10% of them had finally put the design into production by now. 
<br>Maybe because of world economic recovery is on the way, or because of nobody else is still doing VoIP,
or our existed customers products based <a href="../../../ar1688/module.html">AR168M</a> had somewhat attracted world attention,
the requests from all around the world to buy AR168M samples surged during the past week. Quickly we are out of stock.
<br>We have to say sorry to those interested in AR168M. We might not run new production of it unless existing customers place quantity orders in the future.
However, as we provide full hardware design of it, users can still buy AR1688 chip and build the module by themselves.
