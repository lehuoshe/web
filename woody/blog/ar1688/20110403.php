<tr><td>Yesterday a Chinese <a href="../../../ar1688/user/ywh201.html">YWH201</a> user was complaining the phone not working with Freeiris2 system, the login was good but when dial a number, there was always a "wrong number" error.
Following our standard <a href="20070704.php">debug</a> steps, I asked him to update to the latest <a href="../../../ar1688/software/sw052.html">0.52</a> software and checked the phone settings, everything seemed ok.
Then I started to study Freeiris2 web and also search to find what others said about the system. Soon I found it was based on <a href="http://www.asterisk.org/" target=_blank>Asterisk</a>.
Now the answer was clear, for years we knew that we can not enable STUN on all <a href="../../../ar1688/index.html">AR1688</a> and <a href="../../../pa1688/index.html">PA1688</a> devices when working with Asterisk.
After disable STUN on the phone, everything got ok.
<br />We used to test STUN with free services like FWD(free world dialup) and <a href="../../../res/sipphone.html">SIPphone</a>(<a href="http://www.google.com/gizmo5/" target=_blank>Gizmo5</a>).
However, <a href="20071116.php">FWD</a> discontinued service in 2008, and Gizmo5 will also no longer be providing service starting on today. We need to find other good test service right now.
<br /><a href="http://www.gnutelephony.org" target=_blank>GNU Telephony</a> announced GNU Free Call plan last month. And we are also working actively on GNU SIP Witch in addition to our <a href="../../../pa6488/index.html">PA6488</a> SIP development.
But when I tried to see what is new just now, I found the web site inactive. What a bad day!
