<h1>The Interpretation of Sina Stock Data Interface</h1>
<p>Dec 25, 2015
<br />I was planning to add the SZ162411 history net value table,
and found that the I have almost forgotten the meanings of Sina Chinese stock data interface which was analysed 4 months ago.  
In case I will forget them again, I am recording it here for future refernce.
Current data got from <?php EchoSinaDataLink('sz162411'); ?> and saved in <?php EchoSinaDebugLink('sz162411'); ?> as following:
<br /><font color=gray>var hq_str_sz162411="华宝油气,

<br />After removed double quotation marks, separated by ',', the interpretation of words in the next table.

<h3>The Interpretation of Sina Realtime <a name="future">Future</a> Data Interface</h3>
<p>Jan 28, 2016
<br />Recently I added date display in the time field of SZ162411 net value page following the advice of <?php EchoXueqiuId('8907500725', 'oldwain'); ?>.
So the stock interface recorded last time was usaful this time. But I had to review the future interface format again, and adding this record for future use.
<br />Current data got from <?php EchoSinaDataLink('hf_CL'); ?> and saved in file <?php EchoSinaDebugLink('hf_cl'); ?> as following:

<br />After removed double quotation marks, separated by ',', the interpretation of words in the next table.

<h3>The Interpretation of Sina Realtime <a name="fund">Fund</a> Data Interface</h3>
<p>Feb 16, 2016
<br />On 9pm, <?php EchoXueqiuId('5240589924', 'uqot'); ?> told me the calculation of <a href="20150818.php">SZ162411 Net Value</a> was wrong now. 
I checked the debug information, and found that automatic calibration was done on 8pm.
Current data got from <?php EchoSinaDataLink('f_162411'); ?> and saved in <?php EchoSinaDebugLink('f_162411'); ?> as following:
<br /><font color=gray>var hq_str_f_162411="华宝兴业标普油气上游股票(QDII-LOF),
0.406,0.406,0.435,2016-02-15,66.2444";</font>
<br />According to the automatic calibration process in php/<b>_qdii.php</b>, when we got the Feb 15 net value of SZ1682411, we would do calibration with the close price of XOP on Feb 15.
But US market was closed because of President Day, this process was not done. Net step, we will use the previous trading day data to do the calibration. 
However, the previous US market trading day, last Friday was a Chinese New Year holiday, Chinese stock market was closed. The SZ162411 net value of previous trading day was before Chinese New Year.
So the software did wrong calibration based on the SZ162411 net value of last trading day before Chinese New Year and the XOP close price of last Friday. 
The bug only occurs when Chinese and US market close continuesly, and we are lucky the past week just fall into this pattern!
<br />First I recoverd the correct parameters by manual calibration, then I added this record in case we will need the fund data in the future.
<br />After removed double quotation marks, separated by ',', the interpretation of words in the next table.
