<br />It is a difficult task to pick a name. This is why I am still using <a href="../palmmicro/20080326.php">Palmmicro</a> as the company name.
<br />Every child hates his or her name. I guess my daughter will not like her name <a href="../../mia/photo2014.php">Sapphire</a> either. Actually I think she will not like ANY name from me. 
So I just named her with the most straightforward one,
because I believe her <a href="../../res/cateyes.php">jewelry mania</a> mother got pregnant after she bought two cornflower blue sapphire stones from a small shop in World Trade Center of Colombo, Sri Lanka.
