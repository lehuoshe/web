<h1>VoIP Loser's Songs</h1>
<p>March 23, 2011
<br />People are asking why I uploaded such a tired image as my display picture. Because I like this picture taken on Feb, I always wear a tired smile in recent months.
<br />Also in Feb, I was listening a loser's song <b>South of the Border</b> again and again. It was from <b>Cape No.7</b> movie.
In the movie, several losers in a small Taiwan town formed a local band to perform with a visiting Japanese super star.
Yesterday when I was walking near Shenzhen office building, all of a sudden an old melody came up. It was another loser's song <b>Sail Back</b> I used to hear in the spring 20 years ago.
<br />When we started <a href="../../../pa1688/index.html">PA1688</a> VoIP business 10 years ago, we were right that PSTN was to be replaced.
However, we were wrong that it was not replaced by VoIP, but by mobile phone.
<br />It was rather clear that mobile phone would win the market when we started <a href="../../../ar1688/index.html">AR1688</a> business 5 years ago.
However, we were hoping that we could do some kind of WiFi VoIP device to give customers same mobile experience.
I only feel lucky that we did not use external funding to build a dedicated WiFi VoIP chip, thus avoided much larger financial disaster.
<br />2011 is the 3rd year of our <a href="../../../pa6488/index.html">PA6488</a> solution development, I am cautious optimistic about its future.
Just as 20 years ago when I first came in Beijing, optimistic about my future.

<h3>The Way</h3>
<p>Jan 18, 2012
<br /><i><b>The life we live and the life we choose</i></b> 
<br />I watched the movie <b>The Way</b> on a flight several days ago.
A few years ago there was another Chinese movie on the same topic of a sorry father trying to finish the task of his dead son, but I like this one more because it has something more. 
<br />We all need a way to solve our own problems, walking the Camino de Santiago (The Way of Saint James) might be the way.
But in the end, I am glad to see the Dutchman failed to reduce fat and still need to buy a new suit, and the Canadian women failed to quit smoking. This is the life we live. 
<br />As an amateur climber, I like the hiking experience from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago, hope I can just walk the way without any problem to solve in the future.
And I will not say learning Spanish is a bad idea to other people from now on. 
<br />The Canadian women, <i>Deborah Kara Unger</i>, is also in the movie <b>The Game</b>, which is one of my favorite movies.
