<h1>Google <a name="adsense">AdSense</a></h1>
<p>May 9, 2011
<br />With more and more contents in my blog, sometimes I find it necessary to search what topics and details I have written in the past.
I saw a google search box in moftime.com about a year ago. But when I tried to use Google Site Search, I found the sevice charge was at least 100 USD per year and gave up the plan.
<br />During my usage of Google Analytics and Google Webmaster in the past year, I can always see the AdSense and AdWords links.
But I did not catch those service details until I read an article about the market promotion business module of 360buy during my trip from Beijing to Shenzhen last week.
<br />I registered the service after I understood AdSense, it took google a week to approve my account.
Now I have added the Google search box <font color=gray>AdSense for Search</font> and advertisements <font color=gray>AdSense for Content</font> in all my blogs, as it is showed on this page at the bottom.

<h3>AdSense for Search</h3>
<p>Oct 4, 2015
<br />Because of <a href="../palmmicro/20100427.php">GFW</a>, when visit Palmmicro.com from China, the google search box will cause all Javascript to be delayed for over 1 minute.
And according to <a href="#adsense">Adsense</a>, the search box only used for dozens of times in the past 4 and a half years, probably all by myself.
For better customer experience, I removed the search box from all other pages, only kept it here.

<h3>First Payment from Adsense</h3>
<p>Jan 22, 2016
<br />Received an email from billing-noreply@google.com: <font color=gray>Good news! On Jan 21, 2016, we sent you a payment for your Google AdSense earnings.</font>
Then I found the 108.11 USD payment proceeding status was already in my Bank of America account.
<br />The first payment from <a href="#adsense">Adsense</a> comes 3 years earlier than I expected in 2012, it is mainly because my <a href="20150818.php">SZ162411 Net Value</a> page attracted many stock visitors in the past months.
Now the Adsense advertisement page can be show almost 1000 time a day.
