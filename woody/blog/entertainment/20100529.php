<h1>My First Visual C++ 2008 Application</h1>
<p>May 29, 2010
<br />This title would be cool if it read like like <font color=gray>My First iPhone Application</font> or <font color=gray>My First Android Application</font>.
<br />I started with Turbo C for PC applications in 1992. Before 1996 I was using Borland C++, but finally surrendered to Visual C ++ 4.2 in 1997.
In 1999 I upgraded to VC6 with Microsoft and stayed with the version for 10 years.
<br />After I changed to use my <a href="../pa6488/20090808.php">Sony VGN-FW235J</a> in early 2009, finally I had to face the problem that VC6 is not supported in Windows Vista any more.
I had to install this VC9(Visual C++ 2008) instead, but used mostly as a text editor for a year. 
<br />When I was moving Palmmicro web from palmmicro.com.cn to <a href="../palmmicro/20080326.php">Palmmicro</a>.com earlier this year,
I began to write this first application called <b>Woody's Web Tool</b>.
It was designed to do those repeated copy, paste and FTP upload works automatically. As my web work finished recently, my application completed too.
<br />During my development, I was also considering if I should upgrade to Visual C++ 2010. However I met a developer from a professional software company last month and knew that they are still working with VC9,
so I feel comfortable to stay with this version now.
<br />Comparing with VC6, those impressed me with VC9:
</p> 
<ol>
  <li>Although I installed help documents on my local hardware drive, I find it is always fast to get help information online.</li>
  <li>When reusing old VC6 source codes, I had to add _T() to all strings because of strictly unicode check.</li>
  <li>New CHtmlView class makes it so easy to view web files in application.</li>
  <li>New CFtpConnection class also makes it very easy to upload files to FTP servers.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><font color=gray>I still remember going to Hans Bethe and saying, "Hey, Hans! I noticed something interesting.
Here the plate goes around so, and the reason it's two to one is . . ." and I showed him the accelerations.
<br />He says, "Feynman, that's pretty interesting, but what's the importance of it? Why are you doing it?"
<br />"Hah!" I say. "There's no importance whatsoever. I'm just doing it for the fun of it." His reaction didn't discourage me; I had made up my mind I was going to enjoy physics and do whatever I liked.

<h3>From FTP to FTPS</h3>
<p>Feb 19, 2013
<br />Wang Tian is perhaps the only person I know who programs software as entertainment like me. A few years ago when he was still with Microsoft,
one day he suddenly told me that he had just written his first C# application, it felt good he said.
<br />As usual, I was slow on everything. Even I had read about it online frequently and heard Wang Tian's feeling good experience,
C# was not in my mind at all when I started to write <b>Woody's Web Tool</b> in 2010.
I used my familiar MFC and CFtpConnection class to upload files to my web sites.
<br />Starting from last year, Yahoo Web Hosting began to inform me its moveing to only supporting FTPS, the dead line is today.
Since then, I have been learning about FTPS and trying to find an easy solution for my application. The answer is quite simple, FtpWebRequest is ready as early as Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0.
<br />However, the native way to use FtpWebRequest is C#. I spent many time learning how to call it in my <a href="../ar1688/20070609.php">MFC</a> application,
including a lot of VC2008 compiler opition changes. Finally I got my FTPS working today just in time, with lots of exceptions unhandled.
<br />In the meantime, I deleted all Chinese resources from the tool, as I finally accepted the fact that I might be the only person who actually uses the tool,
so it is unnecessary to maintain the extra Chinese resource work.
