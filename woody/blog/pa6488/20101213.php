<tr><td>We have been using G.729 test vectors to test if hardware is stable from PA1688 to PA6488.
<br /><a href="../../../pa1688/index.html">PA1688</a> has a SDRAM interface with very weak driving power. There was panic when we found many customers boards can not work steadily. We needed a method to test in exact bits rather than making a phone call. 
Then we came to the idea of using our DSP developers data of G.723.1 and <a href="../ar1688/20070307.php">G.729</a> test vectors. Based on those data, we provided with all manufacturers detail steps to verify each hardware board by running the test sequences and compare data bit exactly.
<br /><a href="../../../ar1688/index.html">AR1688</a> does not need external DRAM, but we still need to test how fast our DSP can run stably and how <a href="../ar1688/20070216.php">different</a> it was with PA1688. As normal AR1688 device does not have enough space to hold so many test data, 
we were using <a href="../ar1688/20101202.php">AR168DS</a> programmer, which has 4pcs extra program flash, to run the G.729 test vectors.
<br />Now we need to test both DSP speed and DDR2 DRAM interface with <a href="../../../pa6488/index.html">PA6488</a> devices. Although we have no plan to use G.729 with PA6488 devices, 
we still have decided to use its <a href="../../../pa6488/software/devguide/testvectors.html">test vectors</a> in our hardware test, mostly because I like to do repeated jobs. As it is the 3rd time to do the same job, I have finished the calling interfaces and testing process very quickly. 
<br />However, I am never an algorithm guy. What I know about G.729 is only those calling interfaces. All <a href="../palmmicro/20080326.php">Palmmicro</a> G.729 implementations were done by Ph.D candidates in the past 12 years.
