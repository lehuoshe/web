<h1>The History of <a name="palmmicro">Palmmicro</a>.com Domain</h1>
<p>March 26, 2008
<br />In early 1999, <a href="20061123.php">Dr Wang</a> founded Palm Microsystems Inc in Santa Clara and began to use Palmmicro.com.
<br />In late 2002, Palmmicro changed its name to Centrality, the domain registration expired in 2003.
<br />A domain trading company owned it from Dec 25, 2003 to Dec 25, 2007. During this period, Centrality discontinued its <a href="../../../pa1688/index.html">PA1688</a> VoIP business and later acquired by <a href="../entertainment/20070813.php">SiRF</a>.
We founded Palmmicro again in China, continue our small VoIP business with the new <a href="../../../ar1688/index.html">AR1688</a> chip.
<br />On Feb 5, 2008, the expired domain name came into <i>Redemption Period</i>.
<br />On March 6, the domain name became <i>Pending Delete</i>.
<br />On March 13, the domain was strangely registered by an Oregon domain trading company. I was so disappointed at that time.
<br />On today, March 26, I tried <?php EchoExternalLink('https://who.is'); ?> search again, and found the domain name available. I registered it under my name at once.
<br /><font color=gray>Last Sep, Dr Wang, Tang Li and me.</font>

<h3>The History of <a name="aredfox">Aredfox</a>.com</h3>
<p>Jan 7, 2010
<br />On Jun 23, 2000, I regisitered www.aredfox.com domain in east.net, who was also my first email service provider back in 1996.
<br />On Sep 10, 2008, My registeration expired. Another company called ENOM took it at once and put it with trojan.
<br />Today I visited it again and found it had become a search source making traffic money from Google. It is still in ENOM's hand, but I guess it is a bad business for ENOM to keep it. The Alexa traffic rank for aredfox.com is now 24,246,365, maybe just a little better than a blank page.
<br />Palmmicro users, please visit <a href="#palmmicro">Palmmicro</a>.com, we have a new look now.

<h3>The History of Palmmicro.com.<a name="palmmicrocn">cn</a></h3>
<p>March 30, 2010
<br />In 2001, palmmicro.com.cn was first used by Palmmicro Shanghai office, which is now part of <a href="../entertainment/20090219.php">CSR</a>.
<br />As the original Palmmicro changed its name to Centrality in 2002, palmmicro.com.cn expired in 2003.
<br />On Feb 23, 2004, I registered the domain again, redirected it to aredfox.com, using as our Chinese web site. For many years a lot of normal company web sites like palmmicro.com can not be visited from China, and we have to run a separate web site in China for our customers.
<br />On Sep 10, 2008, we discontinued <a href="#aredfox">aredfox.com</a> service and began to use palmmicro.com.cn as our Chinese web site.
<br />On Feb 23, 2010, after more than a year successful visited history of palmmicro.com from China, we decided to discontinue palmmicro.com.cn, and focus our web on <a href="#palmmicro">Palmmicro</a>.com.
<br />The old support@palmmicro.com.cn email also discontinued, please write to <a href="mailto:support@palmmicro.com">support@palmmicro.com</a> to contact us now.
