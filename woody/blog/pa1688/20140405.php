<tr><td>Inspired by the success stories of Dr Wang, nearly all <a href="../palmmicro/20080326.php">Palmmicro</a> early employees started their own businesses after leaving Centrality, <a href="../entertainment/20070813.php">SiRF</a> or <a href="../entertainment/20090219.php">CSR</a>.
Tang Rui was the latest one to join this unsuccessful road. After losing money for a whole year, he asked me one question last month: why <a href="../pa6488/20101225.php">Palm1</a> failed in the mp3 business? 
<br />I had already thought over the question a few years ago, so I can answer him immediately, it was because we wrote the software too bad.
My recent attempt to modify the Palm1/PA1688 software showed just how ugly the software structure was built by myself.
<br />An user sent us several images of his <a href="../../../pa1688/user/ehog.html">eHOG</a> and asked for upgrade software. I have never seen the device before. 
Judging from the PCB I guess it is a mix of <a href="../../../pa1688/user/dp3000.html">PA168P</a> and <a href="../../../pa1688/user/pa168v.html">PA168V</a>.
<br />I decided to add a new <a href="../ar1688/20061014.php">hardware type</a> <font color=gray>EHOG</font>. It must have been a long time since the last time I made serious changes to PA1688 software, so I fully underestimated it. 
<br />I added <b><i>VER_EHOG</i></b> in inc\<b>version.h</b> and modified other related part in the same file and began to compile it with command line <font color=gray>mk ehog sip cn</font>.
Soon I found that I also need to add <b><i>VER_EHOG</i></b> related changes in inc\<b>flags.h</b> and <font color=gray>ehog</font> related changes in <b>make_hex.bat</b>.
After those changes, no compiler error was shown, but I still can not find the upgrade binary file <b>ehog_sip_cn_169006.bin</b> supposed to be generated after compilation.
<br />After checking each steps, I found that I also need to add <font color=gray>ehog</font> to PALMTOOL\P_MERGE\<b>p_merge.cpp</b> and recompile bin\<b>p_merge.exe</b>.
The would be a huge task because <b>p_merge.exe</b> was compiled by VC6.
Considering the effort I made when I was converting AR1688 Windows tools from VC6 to <a href="../ar1688/20100818.php">VC2008</a>, I decided to give up adding hardware type <font color=gray>EHOG</font> to PA1688 software. 
<br />As a typical bad software, <b>p_merge.exe</b> will fail to merge unknown hardware type binary file silently without any warning or error output. And it kept its hardware type text strings in .exe file instead of a configuration file.  
<br />Finally I managed to get an upgrade file <a href="../../../pa1688/software/sw169.html">pa168p_sip_cn_fxo_169006.bin</a> by adding an <i><b>OEM_FXO</b></i> compile option and sent to the user.
To my dismay I was told that the new software did not work with his device.
