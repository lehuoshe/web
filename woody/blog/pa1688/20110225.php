<tr><td>A few days ago an user find us by the 00-09-45 <a href="../palmmicro/20091114.php">MAC</a> address on the back of his phone. I answered the email in the standard way, asking for detail inside and outside pictures of his phone.
From the pictures he sent (see below), I guessed it was a standard <a href="../../../pa1688/user/pa168s.html">PA168S</a> IP phone and directed him to PA1688 <a href="../../../pa1688/software/sw166.html">1.66</a> software download page.
Yesterday he told me his phone now got stuck at "Booting ..." after update.
<br />We are actually familiar with the "Booting ..." problem. Although we never figured out why, we used to sent page0.hex <a href="../pa6488/20090927.php">safe mode</a> file and asking user to update it with <a href="../../../pa1688/software/palmtool.html">PalmTool</a>.
In most cases this worked, but this time I was reluctant to do so. 
<br />I remembered that not long ago another user came up with pictures of <a href="../../../pa1688/user/ip300.html">IP300</a> IP phone, I suggested him to upgrade PA168S software,
and after he got stuck at "Booting ...", I sent him PA168S page0.hex and suggested him to update. Then the phone got completely dead. It was the second time I <a href="../pa1688/20091215.php">killed</a> a PA1688 device by sending out page0.hex.
And it was even worse than the first time, as I still do not know what was wrong. 
<br />I can only guess maybe it is another <a href="../pa1688/20080806.php">none standard</a> PA1688 device, although it looks like PA168S, it actually can not be updated with our standard software. 
And I am going to show the user this article and ask if he is willing to risk with page0.hex again.
