<br /><font color=gray>First, let me thank you for making the pa1688 source code available.
<br />I have a few 5111PHONE units, and they've been working quite well for nearly ten years. However, I have often wished that they had a mute button.
<br />I spend a lot of time on conference calls, and I like to put them on speaker while I half-listen. It is usually a good idea to mute the microphone for obvious reasons ...
<br />... so I have assigned a mute function to the redial button. It's not likely that I will need to redial the previous number while on a call, so it seemed the logical thing to do.
<br />Diff attached. I'd appreciate it if you were to incorporate some version of the patch into your repository, so that I won't have to manually patch the source when I update the firmware.
<br />Thanks again for making the source code free.
</font>
<br />I merged the changes happily and wondered why such a good idea was not implemented in the past 10 years.
Soon I found that in our standard <a href="../../../pa1688/user/pa168s.html">PA168S</a> software, <b>Service IP</b> key was used as <b>Mute</b> key, just in the same way.
<br />As <b>Redial</b> key is much more common, and usually occupies a better position, I applied the changes into <a href="../../../pa1688/software/sw169.html">1.69</a> software for all PA1688 phones. 
<br />Then I checked <a href="../../../ar1688/index.html">AR1688</a> phones, and found that each one had a separate <b>Mute</b> key. Obviously we had made some sort of progress when we design AR1688 solution 7 years ago!
